### Conclusions

1. Data is imbalanced after binary target is introduced. We deciced that from 7 to 10 the quality is good, and we got around 200 occurences of such wine in our data, while we have around 1000 samples for bad wine.

2. We shall use something like F1 score for metrics of prediction quality.
