1. Target variable is an ordinal variable with possible values from 0 to 10. In the particular dataset the range is from 3 to 8.

2. To make it a classification problem we should create binary column and treat `quality` either as good or bad, starting from particular point. For example, >6 is good quality wine.

3. All the variables are in different scale, so for some algorithms we should scale data.

4. Column `Id` is copying id, so it is not needed.
